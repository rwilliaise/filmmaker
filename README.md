# Filmmaker
A (hopefully) in-house animation studio created inside the ROBLOX game engine. Main difference between the default ROBLOX animation studio and Filmmaker will be the introduction of bezier easing - basically using the same industry standard techniques for easing as the animation industry have been for years. In fact, my implementation might be more primitive. I (lego man) am not entirely sure, though.

## Contributing
Make sure you read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://tbj-team.github.io/contributing/) on our site. However, a nice synopsis would just be **code neatly.** 

If you submit cooked spaghetti for your PR, the chances (or ladies) you will get at your PR getting merged will drop to a number so infitesimally small, that if you tried to PR every second for the rest of time, the heat death of the universe would've already destroyed the computer you were submitting it on.

## Submitting issues
Please, for the love of all that is holy, **give context**. Whether it is a bug, a feature, or an enhancement, please give context to either

1. how to reproduce the bug
2. how to use the new feature
3. how the enhancement would be useful

We cannot do our work if we don't even **know** what to work on. So please, give the appropriate context.

### How to submit features
When you submit features (or enhancements for that matter), try to also submit images or a visual diagram to what the feature should look like or a simple mockup would be.

It would greatly decrease development time thinking of a new idea for the look of that specific feature, and it would also increase the chances of your feature getting accepted.

## Boring lists
Lists of things that need to be done eventually. Probably should use the Projects function in Github, however I am too lazy to set that up.
