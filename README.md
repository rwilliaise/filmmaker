# Filmmaker
An in-house animation studio created inside the ROBLOX game engine. Main difference between the default ROBLOX animation studio and Filmmaker will be the introduction of bezier easing - basically using the same industry standard techniques for easing as the animation industry have been for years. In fact, my implementation might be more primitive. I am not entirely sure, though.

## Boring lists
Lists of things that need to be done eventually. Probably should use the Projects function in Github, however I am too lazy to set that up.
